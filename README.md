## APIs Used üåê

1. **OpenWeatherMap Geo Direct API**: Used for fetching city suggestions based on user input.
   - Endpoint: `https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct`
2. **OpenWeatherMap Weather API**: Used to fetch weather details by city name.
   - Endpoint: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
3. **OpenWeatherMap Weather by Coordinates API**: Used to fetch weather details by latitude and longitude.
   - Endpoint: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`

## Approach üß†

### 1. **City Search with Auto-Suggestions**
- Users can start typing a city name into the search bar.
- The app implements a debouncing mechanism (2 seconds) to minimize API calls.
- If the user stops typing for 2 seconds and has entered more than 3 characters, the app fetches city suggestions using the Geo Direct API.

### 2. **Dropdown with City Suggestions**
- City suggestions are displayed in a dropdown menu.
- Users can click on any suggestion to select a city, triggering a weather fetch by coordinates.

### 3. **Search Button Functionality**
- If the user clicks the "Search" button without selecting a suggestion, the app fetches weather data by city name.

### 4. **Displaying Weather Data**
- The app displays current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and an 5-day forecast.
- Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.

## Usage üìñ

- Enter a city name in the search bar.
- Choose a city from the dropdown or click the "Search" button.
- View current weather, hourly, and 8-day forecasts.
- Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit as needed.
